//Tic-Tac-Toe rules:
//• X always goes first
//• Players alternate placing X's and O's on the board
//• Players cannot play on a played position
//• A player with three X's or O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
//• If all nine squares are filled and neither player achieves three in a row, the game is a draw
